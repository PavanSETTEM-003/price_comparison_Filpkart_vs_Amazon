# price_comparison_Filpkart_vs_Amazon
This project is designed to help users compare the prices and key features of products on Flipkart and Amazon, and make informed decisions based on the available information.<br>

The project works by allowing the user to input the name of the product they are interested in. The code then searches the Flipkart and Amazon datasets for the product and retrieves the relevant details, including the prices and key features. The comparison data is then presented to the user in a table or other format, allowing them to easily see the differences between the products and make an informed decision.

Overall, this can be a helpful tool for users who are looking to compare prices and features of products on Flipkart and Amazon, and make informed purchasing decisions.
